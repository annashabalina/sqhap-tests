Feature: to test that roles are defined correctly for the users,
  I want to login to the application and see information that corresponds to my role

  Scenario Outline: login and verify tabs
    Given I am on the login page
    When I login as "<userRole>"
    Then I can see "<corresponding tabs>" on my home page
    Examples:
      | userRole    | corresponding tabs                |
      | admin       | Candidates, Interviewers, Reports |
      | supervisor  | Candidates, Interviewers, Reports |
      | interviewer | Reports                           |
